From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the novel creates scenes and characters that have fired the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons,,is, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S.

Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, crypt analyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. \When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its real duty—we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.\,All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes—inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe—team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Science Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction,Science Fiction,Cyberpunk,Thriller,Historical,Science Fiction Fantasy,War,Fantasy,Novels","Douglas MacArthur,Enoch Root,Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse,Robert Shaftoe,Earl Comstock,Rudolf von Hacklheber,Alan Turing","Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, England,Southeast Asia,Philippines",English,November 5th 2002,4.24

His plan is to travel to Pompeii and put together an expedition, then head out to the place where he believes the fault lies. But Pompeii proves to be a corrupt and violent town, and Attilius soon discovers that there are powerful forces at work—both natural and man-made—threatening to destroy him.,With his trademark elegance and intelligence, Robert Harris, bestselling author of Archangel and Fatherland, re-creates a world on the brink of disaster.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Historical,Historical Fiction,Fiction,Historical,Cultural,Italy,Thriller,Mystery,Novels,Roman,Adventure,Audiobook","Attilius,Corelia,Ampliatus,Pliny",Pompeii,English,November 8th 2005,3.82

Witch, barbarian, foreigner, or a woman wronged and committed to the most horrific kind of justice, Medea is a heroine who makes her audience shudder. Euripides shows us an astonishingly strong female protagonist, whom some readers have identified as the first feminist in Western literature. Seeing where her strength leads her, though, we must wonder if she was intended to be portrayed a model or as a warning. Because the three other plays that were traditionally performed with Medea have been lost, it is difficult to say whether EuripidesÂ� Athenian audience was as upset by the play as modern readers are. It won only third place at the biggest festival in the city, indicating that ancient audiences also found it controversial.

Next, Cunningham presents Woolf herself, beginning work in 1923 on what is to become IMrs. Dalloway/I. And finally we are introduced to Laura Brown, a California housewife who is avidly reading Woolf's novel. p,Scenes from these three narratives are presented in recurrent identical succession: \Mrs. Dalloway,\ Mrs. Woolf, Mrs. Brown -- all bristling with connections and startling parallels. The \Mrs. Dalloway\ strand is particularly rich, filled as it is with one-to-one correspondences to Woolf's novel. But the deepest and most important thing that IThe Hours/I shares with IMrs. Dalloway/I is \the feeling,\ as Woolf called it, \that it was very, very dangerous to live even one day.\ Cunningham's three women proceed through the day, through the hours, trying to keep themselves psychologically intact, like someone carrying a glass of water filled to the brim through a crowd and endeavoring not to spill it. They hesitate before plunging into the day because they know how hard it is to live in the world and remain identical with oneself. And they puzzle over a universal dilemma: how to bring the self into the world without its getting broken in the process.

Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Abraham Lincoln waited in their hometowns for the results from the Republican National Convention in Chicago. When Lincoln emerged as the victor, his rivals were dismayed and angry.,Throughout the turbulent 1850s, each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over slavery was leading inexorably to secession and civil war. That Lincoln succeeded, Goodwin demonstrates, was the result of a character that had been forged by experiences that raised him above his more privileged and accomplished rivals. He won because he possessed an extraordinary ability to put himself in the place of other men, to experience what they were feeling, to understand their motives and desires.,It was this capacity that enabled Lincoln as president to bring his disgruntled opponents together, create the most unusual cabinet in history, and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the Union and winning the war.,We view the long, horrifying struggle from the vantage of the White House as Lincoln copes with incompetent generals, hostile congressmen, and his raucous cabinet. He overcomes these obstacles by winning the respect of his former competitors, and in the case of Seward, finds a loyal and crucial friend to see him through.,This brilliant multiple biography is centered on Lincoln's mastery of men and how it shaped the most significant presidency in the nation's history.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,History,Nonfiction,Biography,Politics,North American Hi...,American History,Military History,Civil War,Politics,Presidents,Leadership,Historical,Audiobook","Abraham Lincoln,William H.

It is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time, much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of Adams family letters and diaries. In particular, the more than one thousand surviving letters between John and Abigail Adams, nearly half of which have never been published, provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know John Adams as no other major American of his founding era.,As he has with stunning effect in his previous books, McCullough tells the story from within -- from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who, caught up in events, had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, the British spy Edward Bancroft, Madame Lafayette and Jefferson's Paris \interest\ Maria Cosway, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, the scandalmonger James Callender, Sally Hemings, John Marshall, Talleyrand, and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle, as does, importantly, John Quincy Adams, the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President.,Crucial to the story, as it was to history, is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson, born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer's son, the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder, one short and stout, the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson, very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country.,At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries, then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties, they became archrivals, even enemies, in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800, perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then, amazingly, they became friends again, and ultimately, incredibly, they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4, in the year 1826.,Much about John Adams's life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate Boston in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget.,It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI, from Spain to Amsterdam, from the Court of St. James's, where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation, to the raw, half-finished Capital by the Potomac, where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House.,This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, John Adams is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,History,Biography,Nonfiction,North American Hi...,American History,Politics,Presidents,Politics,Historical,Biography Memoir,Military History,American Revolution,Audiobook","John Adams,Benjamin Franklin,John Dickinson,Abigail Adams,George Washington,Thomas Jefferson","Boston, Massachusetts,Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",English,May 22nd 2001,4.04

With a tremendous cracking and splintering of oak, it struck the ship just beneath the anchor secured at the cat-head on the port bow...\,brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours, and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick. In a harrowing page-turner, Nathaniel Philbrick restores this epic story to its rightful place in American history.,In 1820, the 240-ton Essex set sail from Nantucket on a routine voyage for whales. Fifteen months later, in the farthest reaches of the South Pacific, it was repeatedly rammed and sunk by an eighty-ton bull sperm whale. Its twenty-man crew, fearing cannibals on the islands to the west, made for the 3,000-mile-distant coast of South America in three tiny boats. During ninety days at sea under horrendous conditions, the survivors clung to life as one by one, they succumbed to hunger, thirst, disease, and fear.,Philbrick interweaves his account of this extraordinary ordeal of ordinary men with a wealth of whale lore and with a brilliantly detailed portrait of the lost, unique community of Nantucket whalers. Impeccably researched and beautifully told, the book delivers the ultimate portrait of man against nature, drawing on a remarkable range of archival and modern sources, including a long-lost account by the ship's cabin boy.,At once a literary companion and a page-turner that speaks to the same issues of class, race, and man's relationship to nature that permeate the works of Melville,,will endure as a vital work of American history.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,History,Nonfiction,Adventure,Historical,Adventure,Survival,North American Hi...,American History,Audiobook,Biography,Adventure,Maritime,Adult","George Pollard,Thomas Nickerson,Owen Chase,Benjamin Lawrence,Matthew Joy,Thomas Chappel,Owen Coffin,Barzillai Ray","Nantucket, Massachusetts,South Pacific",English,April 2nd 2001,4.11

It changed from a farce to a tragedy while I was going along with it,\ Twain wrote in his frank afternote to the novel. In the end, the voice that comes to dominate the tale is Roxana's, a light-skinned slave who switches her infant son with her master's son to keep him from being sold down the river.

At his best, Twain is the most uniquely American of writers, and it is inevitable that his best work revolves around the issues of race and of slavery embedded in the American psyche.

She’s in her late thirties and has a boring cubicle job at a communications company, doing work that is only slightly more bearable than the time she spends alone in her depressingly sterile box of a condo. Her whole life, she’s tried to get to the root of her sadness, to figure out what she’s been doing wrong, with little success. But then, one night in 1997, everything changes: while standing in the parking lot of a video store, arms full of sappy movies she’s rented to help her convalesce from oral surgery, she witnesses the passing of the Hale-Bopp comet. For Liz, this streak of light across the sky is a portent of radical change — and for her, radical change means finally accepting her lot: “I realized that my life, while technically adequate, had become all it was ever going to be … No more trying to control everything — it was now time to go with the flow.” In that moment, and for the first time, Liz feels truly free.,A day after Liz makes the decision to seek peace in her life rather than control, along comes another comet, in the form of a stranger admitted to the local hospital with her name and number inscribed on his MedicAlert bracelet. For the new Liz, the phone call from the hospital feels like “the fulfillment of a prophecy”; the young man, it turns out, is her son, whom she gave up for adoption when she was sixteen. Jeremy shows the scars of his years as a foster child and his most recent drug reaction, but is otherwise beautiful and charming. And when he moves in with Liz to recuperate, it’s as if both of them had been waiting for this moment all their lives.,A lost soul and occasional visionary, Jeremy upends Liz’s quiet existence — shocking her coworkers and family, redecorating her condo, getting her to reevaluate her past and take an active role in her future. But he’s also very ill with multiple sclerosis. Her son’s life-and-death battle induces a spiritual awakening in Liz — then triggers a chain of events that take her to the other side of the world and back, endangering her life just as an unexpected second chance at happiness finally seems within reach.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Cultural,Canada,Contemporary,Novels,Literature,Literary Fiction,Adult Fiction,Literature,Canadian Literature,Humor,Drama","Jeremy,Liz Dunn",Canada,English,May 23rd 2005,3.66

Dr Iannis practices medicine on the island of Cephalonia, accompanied by his daughter, Pelagia, to whom he imparts much of his healing art. Even when the Italians do invade, life isn’t so bad—at first anyway. The officer in command of the Italian garrison is the cultured Captain Antonio Corelli, who responds to a Nazi greeting of “Heil Hitler” with his own “Heil Puccini”, and whose most precious possession is his mandolin. It isn't long before Corelli and Pelagia are involved in a heated affair--despite her engagement to a young fisherman, Mandras, who has gone off to join Greek partisans. Love is complicated enough in wartime, even when the lovers are on the same side. And for Corelli and Pelagia, it becomes increasingly difficult to negotiate the minefield of allegiances, both personal and political, as all around them atrocities mount, former friends become enemies and the ugliness of war infects everyone it touches.,British author Louis de Bernières is well known for his forays into magical realism in such novels as The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts, Señor Vivo and the Coca Lord and The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman. Here he keeps it to a minimum, though certainly the secondary characters with whom he populates his island—the drunken priest, the strongman, the fisherman who swims with dolphins—would be at home in any of his wildly imaginative Latin American fictions. Instead, de Bernières seems interested in dissecting the nature of history as he tells his ever-darkening tale from many different perspectives. Captain Corelli’s Mandolin works on many levels, as a love story, a war story and a deconstruction of just what determines the facts that make it into the history books.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction,Romance,Classics,War,Historical,Cultural,Greece,War,World War II,Novels,Literature","Pelagia,Antonio Corelli,Mandras,Dr Iannis","Cephallonia,Greece",English,August 29th 1995,3.99

The years after the Civil War represented an astonishing moment of opportunity for African-Americans. The rush to build a racially democratic society from the ruins of slavery is never more evident than in the personal history of Blanche Kelso Bruce and his heirs.,Born a slave in 1841, Bruce became a local Mississippi sheriff, developed a growing Republican power base, amassed a real-estate fortune, and became the first black to serve a full Senate term. He married Josephine Willson, the daughter of a wealthy black Philadelphia doctor. Together they broke racial barriers as a socialite couple in 1880s Washington, D.C.,By befriending President Ulysses S. Grant, abolitionist Frederick Douglass, and a cadre of liberal black and white Republicans, Bruce spent six years in the U.S. Senate, then gained appointments under four presidents Garfield, Arthur, Harrison, and McKinley, culminating with a top Treasury post, which placed his name on all U.S. currency.,During Reconstruction, the Bruce family entertained lavishly in their two Washington town houses and acquired an 800-acre plantation, homes in four states, and a fortune that allowed their son and grandchildren to attend Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard University, beginning in 1896.,The Senator's legacy would continue with his son, Roscoe, who became both a protégé of Booker T. Washington and a superintendent of Washington, D.C.'s segregated schools. When the family moved to New York in the 1920s and formed an alliance with John D. Rockefeller Jr., the Bruces became an enviable force in Harlem society. Their public battle to get their grandson admitted into Harvard University's segregated dormitories elicited the support of people like W. E. B. Du Bois and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and broke brave new ground for blacks of their day.,But in the end, the Bruce dynasty's wealth and stature would disappear when the Senator's grandson landed in prison following a sensational trial and his Radcliffe-educated granddaughter married a black Hollywood actor who passed for white.,By drawing on Senate records, historic documents, and the personal letters of Senator Bruce, Josephine, their colleagues, friends, children, and grandchildren, author Lawrence Otis Graham weaves a riveting social history that spans 120 years. From Mississippi to Washington, D.C., to New York,,provides a fascinating look into the history of race and class in America.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,History,Nonfiction,Biography,Cultural,African American,Historical,Sociology,Race,Politics,North American Hi...,American History",Blanche K.

A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories. . . until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape. Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments, and fundamental changes that affect us all. Shining with a beauty that is rarely found in current literature, The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Romance,Fiction,Womens Fiction,Chick Lit,Contemporary,Adult,Adult Fiction,Romance,Contemporary Romance,Love,Classics,Drama","Noah Taylor Calhoun,Allison Nelson,Lon Hammond Jr,Anne Nelson","New Bern, North Carolina,North Carolina",English,December 1st 1999,4.11

Fortnum is kidnapped by Paraguayan revolutionaries who have mistaken him for the American Ambassador. Realizing their error, they threaten to execute him anyway if their demands are not met. Plarr, torn between his instinctive feeling for the revolutionaries -- one of whom is an old friend -- and his ambiguous relationship with Fortnum, whose wife he has taken as a lover, becomes involved in a tragicomedy that leads inexorably to a meaningless death.,At the center of,is Plarr, a brilliant Graham Greene creation, perhaps the most moving and convincing figure in his fiction. Plarr is a man so cut off from human feeling, so puzzled by the emotional needs of men like Fortnum, that he is paradoxically vulnerable, chillingly exposed, and required in the end to pay with his life for the illusions that other people believe in and that he himself cannot share.,In the men and women who surround Plarr -- Clara, who has moved from the brothel to Charley Fortnum's bedroom; Father Rivas, the revolutionary priest who dominates those near him, despite his unsanctified marriage and belief in political terror; Saavedra, the Argentinean novelist, whose work lugubriously mirrors the world around him; Aquino, the poet-turned-revolutionary; Colonel Perez, the cheerfully efficient chief of police -- Graham Greene has created a world peculiarly his own. It is a world illuminated by that special passion for the complexities of love, faith, compassion, and betrayal that lies at the very heart of his work.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Classics,Novels,European Literature,British Literature,Literature,Thriller,Mystery,Literary Fiction,Literature,20th Century,Spy Thriller,Espionage","Eduardo Plarr,Charles Fortnum,Julio Saavedra",Argentina,English,September 11th 2000,3.79

Galardonada con los premios Whitbread y Guardian, además de quedar finalista en todos los demás concursos literarios importantes de Gran Bretaña,,ha sido portada del,y,y, por si fuera poco, ha ocupado los primeros puestos en las listas de libros más vendidos en ambas orillas del Atlántico.,Situado en un barrio londinense de inmigrantes, el inmenso fresco humano que dibuja la autora tiene como epicentro las familias de Archie Jones y Samad Iqbal, dos ex combatientes de la Segunda Guerra Mundial que vuelven a encontrarse después de treinta años sin verse. Archie está casado con una jamaicana exuberante que ha perdido los dientes frontales, y Samad con Alsana, bengalí como él, y con las ideas muy claras. Uno trabaja en un taller de manipulados de papel y el otro se gana el sustento de camarero en un restaurante, pero su mayor problema no ha sido la guerra, ni la falta de dinero, ni el hecho de estar casados con mujeres jóvenes de carácter endemoniado. No, la prueba más dura que les ha deparado la vida es la relación con sus hijos. Éstos, que deberían llevar a cabo los proyectos fracasados de sus padres, se rebelan. Se rebelan contra el racismo británico, contra su propia clase social, incluso contra sus orígenes, su historia y su barrio. Así, cada uno a su manera, son la prueba viviente de lo difícil que resulta escapar del propio destino.,Con una acertada mezcla de sátira extravagante y humor corrosivo, y una profusión de personajes y situaciones que mantienen en vilo al lector, Zadie Smith exhibe una consumada habilidad de novelista, como si tuviera años de experiencia en el oficio. La extraordinaria energía que desprende la narración hace que la lectura de,perdure en la memoria de quienes entienden que una novela puede ser tan entretenida como fiel testigo de la realidad de su tiempo.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Contemporary,Novels,Literary Fiction,European Literature,British Literature,Literature,Historical,Historical Fiction,Adult Fiction,Classics,Race","Alfred Archibald Jones,Samad Miah Iqbal,Clara Bowden,Alsana Begum,Irie Ambrosia Jones,Millat Zulfikar Iqbal,Hortense Bowden,Mr Topps,Joyce Chalfen,Marcus Chalfen,Magid Iqbal,Joshua Chalfen","Willesden, North London",Spanish,June 30th 2005,3.78

Imbued with an Egyptian sense of humor and deeply rooted in the culture and politics of the modern period, the novel takes a humorous but often black look at the changes that have occurred in Egypt over the past few decades. Zaat's life experiences and relationships are set against economic and social upheavals in a style that is both sophisticated and bawdy, highly ironic and often extremely poignant. Zaat's story is interspersed and illustrated with extracts from newspapers of the day headlines, articles, captions, death notices, advertisements reflecting events and incidents contemporary with her life. Beautifully put together with bitter and cutting irony, they tell of corruption, financial scandals, torture, foreign debt, and social problems. The heroine epitomizes the hopes, dreams, and ambitions of simple folk tossed about on the stormy sea of modernization, consumerism, and the ever-present mirage of new wealth. Zaat is a brilliant social commentary that provides keen insights into how Egypt has come to be the way it is today.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Novels,Fiction,Northern Africa,Egypt,Literature,Social,Politics,Cultural,Africa,Media Tie In,Academic,Read For School,Unfinished","ذات,عبد المجيد",Egypt,Arabic,March 15th 2004,3.56

Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her talented cockatoo; the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie, whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly, comically thwarted; gay blade Dorian Greene; sinister Miss Lee, proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub; and Myrna Minkoff, the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave through A Confederacy of Dunces are as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind, a fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life. --Alix Wilber--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.,,From Library Journal,The Pulitzer Prize-winning novel with the sad history turns 20 LJ 4/15/80.

Her family is not pleased – as her brother Jamie observes, Ray has “strangler’s hands.” Katie can’t decide if she loves Ray, or loves the wonderful way he has with her son Jacob, and her mother Jean is a bit put out by all the planning and arguing the wedding has occasioned, which get in the way of her quite fulfilling late-life affair with one of her husband’s ex-colleagues. And the tidy and pleasant life Jamie has created crumbles when he fails to invite his lover, Tony, to the dreaded nuptials.,Unnoticed in the uproar, George discovers a sinister lesion on his hip, and quietly begins to lose his mind.,The way these damaged people fall apart – and come together – as a family is the true subject of Haddon’s disturbing yet amusing portrait of a dignified man trying to go insane politely.,A SPOT OF BOTHER is Mark Haddon’s unforgettable follow-up to the internationally beloved bestseller THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME.

Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies.,Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness.,Angela's Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Nonfiction,Autobiography,Memoir,Biography,Classics,Cultural,Ireland,Biography,Autobiography,Biography Memoir,History,European Literature,Irish Literature,Historical",Frank McCourt,"Limerick,New York State,Ireland",English,December 17th 1998,4.12

There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddle—yet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Magical Realism,Fantasy,Cultural,Japan,Asian Literature,Japanese Literature,Contemporary,Novels,Literature,Literary Fiction,Cultural,Asia","Kafka Tamura,Sakura,Satoru Nakata,Oshima,Miss Saeki,Hoshino",Takamatsu,English,January 3rd 2006,4.13

Henry wakes to the comfort of his large home in central London on this, his day off. He is as at ease here as he is in the operating room. Outside the hospital, the world is not so easy or predictable. There is an impending war against Iraq, and a general darkening and gathering pessimism since the New York and Washington attacks two years before.,On this particular Saturday morning, Perowne's day moves through the ordinary to the extraordinary. After an unusual sighting in the early morning sky, he makes his way to his regular squash game with his anaesthetist, trying to avoid the hundreds of thousands of marchers filling the streets of London, protesting against the war.

But what makes,extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape.,Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.,The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Historical,Historical Fiction,Fiction,Historical,Classics,Fantasy,Historical,Medieval,Audiobook,European Literature,British Literature,Novels,Adult","Thomas Becket,Henry II of England,Tom Builder,Prior Philip,Aliena,Jack Jackson,Stephen of England,Empress Matilda,William Hamleigh,Ellen,Richard of Kingsbridge,Alfred Builder,Waleran Bigod,Lord Percy Hamleigh,Lady Regan Hamleigh,Remigius",England,English,February 4th 2002,4.32

Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure.

Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield, Nancy Cunard, and John Middleton Murry, as well as Huxley himself.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Classics,Literature,Novels,Philosophy,European Literature,British Literature,Literature,English Literature,Literature,20th Century,Classics,Modern Classics,Literary Fiction","Marjorie Carling,Walter Bidlake,John Bidlake,Hilda Tantamount,Philip Quarles,Edward Tantamount,Lucy Tantamount,Frank Illidge,Everard Webley,Denis Burlap,Elinor Bidlake,Molly d'Exergillod,Mark Rampion,Mary Rampion,Maurice Spandrell,Beatrice Gilray,Sidney Quarles",United Kingdom,English,October 1st 1996,3.86

Armani! Versace!\ at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child.,THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA gives a rich and hilarious new meaning to complaints about “The Boss from Hell.” Narrated in Andrea’s smart, refreshingly disarming voice, it traces a deep, dark, devilish view of life at the top only hinted at in gossip columns and over Cosmopolitans at the trendiest cocktail parties. From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda’s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day—and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, however, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her. And even if she survives, she has to decide whether or not the job is worth the price of her soul.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Womens Fiction,Chick Lit,Fiction,Contemporary,Romance,Adult,Humor,Adult Fiction,Couture,Fashion,Novels,Realistic Fiction","Andrea Sachs,Miranda Priestly,Alexander Fineman,Emily,Lily Goodwin","New York City, New York",English,May 30th 2006,3.76

The narrator is a farm boy named Luke Chandler, age seven, who lives in the cotton fields with his parents and grandparents in a little house that's never been painted. The Chandlers farm eighty acres that they rent, not own, and when the cotton is ready they hire a truckload of Mexicans and a family from the Ozarks to help harvest it.,For six weeks they pick cotton, battling the heat, the rain, the fatigue, and sometimes each other. As the weeks pass Luke sees and hears things no seven-year-old could possibly be prepared for, and he finds himself keeping secrets that not only threaten the crop but will change the lives of the Chandlers forever.,©2000, 2001 Belfry Holdings, Inc.

But Mr. Kapasi has problems enough of his own; in addition to his regular job working as an interpreter for a doctor who does not speak his patients' language, he also drives tourists to local sites of interest. His fare on this particular day is Mr. and Mrs. Das--first-generation Americans of Indian descent--and their children. During the course of the afternoon, Mr. Kapasi becomes enamored of Mrs. Das and then becomes her unwilling confidant when she reads too much into his profession. \I told you because of your talents,\ she informs him after divulging a startling secret.,Of course, Mr. Kapasi has no cure for what ails Mrs. Das--or himself. Lahiri's subtle, bittersweet ending is characteristic of the collection as a whole. Some of these nine tales are set in India, others in the United States, and most concern characters of Indian heritage. Yet the situations Lahiri's people face, from unhappy marriages to civil war, transcend ethnicity. As the narrator of the last story, \The Third and Final Continent,\ comments: \There are times I am bewildered by each mile I have traveled, each meal I have eaten, each person I have known, each room in which I have slept.\ In that single line Jhumpa Lahiri sums up a universal experience, one that applies to all who have grown up, left home, fallen in or out of love, and, above all, experienced what it means to be a foreigner, even within one's own family.,Interpreter of Maladies unerringly charts the emotional journeys of characters seeking love beyond the barriers of nations and generations.

There was nothing wild, nothing immodest in her manner: it was quiet and self-controlled, a little melancholy and a little touched by suspicion; not exactly the manner of a lady, and, at the same time, not the manner of a woman in the humblest rank of life.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Classics,Mystery,Fiction,Gothic,Horror,Literature,19th Century,Historical,Victorian,Historical,Historical Fiction,Literature,European Literature,British Literature","Walter Hartright,Marian Halcombe,Anne Catherick,Sir Percival Glyde,Count Fosco,Frederick Fairlie,Laura Fairlie,Madame Fosco,Mr. Gilmore","Cumberland, England,London, England,Hampshire, England,England,United Kingdom",English,February 1st 2004,3.99

The trilogy, however, is more than a journey into the past. Undset's own life--her familiarity with Norse sagas and folklore and with a wide range of medieval literature, her experiences as a daughter, wife, and mother, and her deep religious faith--profoundly influenced her writing. Her grasp of the connections between past and present and of human nature itself, combined with the extraordinary quality of her writing, sets her works far above the genre of -historical novels.- This new translation by Tina Nunnally--the first English version since Charles Archer's translation in the 1920s--captures Undset's strengths as a stylist. Nunnally, an award-winning translator, retains the natural dialog and lyrical flow of the original Norwegian, with its echoes of Old Norse legends, while deftly avoiding the stilted language and false archaisms of Archer's translation. In addition, she restores key passages left out of that edition.Undset's ability to present a meticulously accurate historical portrait without sacrificing the poetry and narrative drive of masterful storytelling was particularly significant in her homeland. Granted independence in 1905 after five hundred years of foreign domination, Norway was eager to reclaim its national history and culture.,became a touchstone for Undset's contemporaries, and continues to be widely read by Norwegians today.

Kay, who nearly killed the Werewolf in self-defense as,came to a close, now finds herself the target of a corrupt police investigation that will dredge her darkest secrets from the deepest corners of her past.,Torn between a desire to clear her name and the instinct of a wounded animal to turn against even its would-be rescuers, Kay sifts through the forensic evidence that seems to link Chandonne to other horrific events in her past, up to and including Wesley's murder.

Instead, Kay must rely on the strategic support of her niece, cofounder of the Last Precinct an odd, ill-defined organization that is, in the words of its motto, \where you go when there is nowhere left\, and on her willingness to examine her own fears, misconceptions, and anything-but-altruistic motives.

More disturbing than these occasional lapses, however, is the feeling that Cornwell has written herself into a corner.

In outward form,,is a Dickensian coming-of-age journey: Young dreamer Eiji Miyake, from remote rural Japan, thrust out on his own by his sister’s death and his mother’s breakdown, comes to Tokyo in pursuit of the father who abandoned him. Stumbling around this strange, awesome city, he trips over and crosses—through a hidden destiny or just monstrously bad luck—a number of its secret power centers. Suddenly, the riddle of his father’s identity becomes just one of the increasingly urgent questions Eiji must answer. Why is the line between the world of his experiences and the world of his dreams so blurry? Why do so many horrible things keep happening to him? What is it about the number 9? To answer these questions, and ultimately to come to terms with his inheritance, Eiji must somehow acquire an insight into the workings of history and fate that would be rare in anyone, much less in a boy from out of town with a price on his head and less than the cost of a Beatles disc to his name.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Cultural,Japan,Fantasy,Magical Realism,Contemporary,Literary Fiction,Literature,Novels,European Literature,British Literature,Science Fiction","Eiji Miyake,Ai Imajo,Yuzu Daimon,Buntaro Ogiso",Tokyo,English,February 11th 2003,3.86

Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city has become a modern classic.,Shots rang out in Savannah's grandest mansion in the misty, early morning hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.,It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the \soul of pampered self-absorption\; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Nonfiction,Crime,True Crime,Mystery,Mystery,Crime,History,American,Southern,Classics,Travel,Autobiography,Memoir,Audiobook","Jim Williams,Danny Hansford","Savannah, Georgia",English,September 27th 2005,3.92

Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an \excitement addict.\ Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever.,Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home.,What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.,For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots.

Ellis focuses on six discrete moments that exemplify the most crucial issues facing the fragile new nation: Burr and Hamilton's deadly duel, and what may have really happened; Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison's secret dinner, during which the seat of the permanent capital was determined in exchange for passage of Hamilton's financial plan; Franklin's petition to end the \peculiar institution\ of slavery--his last public act--and Madison's efforts to quash it; Washington's precedent-setting Farewell Address, announcing his retirement from public office and offering his country some final advice; Adams's difficult term as Washington's successor and his alleged scheme to pass the presidency on to his son; and finally, Adams and Jefferson's renewed correspondence at the end of their lives, in which they compared their different views of the Revolution and its legacy.,In a lively and engaging narrative, Ellis recounts the sometimes collaborative, sometimes archly antagonistic interactions between these men, and shows us the private characters behind the public personas: Adams, the ever-combative iconoclast, whose closest political collaborator was his wife, Abigail; Burr, crafty, smooth, and one of the most despised public figures of his time; Hamilton, whose audacious manner and deep economic savvy masked his humble origins; Jefferson, renowned for his eloquence, but so reclusive and taciturn that he rarely spoke more than a few sentences in public; Madison, small, sickly, and paralyzingly shy, yet one of the most effective debaters of his generation; and the stiffly formal Washington, the ultimate realist, larger-than-life, and America's only truly indispensable figure.,Ellis argues that the checks and balances that permitted the infant American republic to endure were not primarily legal, constitutional, or institutional, but intensely personal, rooted in the dynamic interaction of leaders with quite different visions and values. Revisiting the old-fashioned idea that character matters, Founding Brothers informs our understanding of American politics--then and now--and gives us a new perspective on the unpredictable forces that shape history.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,History,Nonfiction,North American Hi...,American History,Politics,Military History,American Revolution,Biography,Historical,Politics,Presidents,American Revolution,American Revolutionary War,Literature,American","Alexander Hamilton,Aaron Burr,John Adams,Benjamin Franklin,George Washington,Thomas Jefferson,James Madison",Defuniak Springs,English,February 5th 2002,3.94

In this delightful romance about the man too self-centered to fall in love and the woman too unsure of herself to want more out of life than the little she already has, George Bernard Shaw shakes the dust off the Cinderella story and tells it as only he can. Eliza Doolittle, the Cockney flower girl who wants to work in a flower shop, and Henry Higgins, the phoneticist who turns her into a \princess,\ are no mythological knight and maiden. Instead, even today, they resound with sharp humor and cutting dialogue. Originally published in 1914, Pygmalion invites readers and audience members to examine the roots of social prejudice and the true value of a human being, while also involving them in the improbable lives of Shaw�s one-dimensional, yet endearing characters.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Classics,Plays,Fiction,Drama,Plays,Theatre,Academic,School,Literature,Romance,European Literature,British Literature,Academic,Read For School","Henry Higgins,Eliza Doolittle,Colonel Pickering,Alfred P.

This wildly imaginative, red-headed chatterbox tries to fit into the narrow confines of Victorian expectations, but her exuberant spirit keeps leaping delightfully beyond the bounds. Indeed, when Maud Montgomery decided to reject the sermonizing formulas of the children's books of her day, she brought to life a character much closer to Jane Eyre, David Copperfield, and Tom Sawyer--also orphans, like Anne--than to the self-sacrificing, conformist heroines then in demand. In doing so, Montgomery subtly questioned the values of her society--the stifling restraints of its religion and most especially its treatment of women--while giving readers all the pleasures of her considerable story-telling gifts.,Now, in this first fully annotated edition of,, readers will appreciate more clearly than ever before the scope and depth of this extraordinary novel. Editors Margaret Anne Doody, Mary Doody Jones, and Wendy Barry provide a richly illustrated, completely revised text, along with hundreds of notes describing the real-life characters and settings Anne encounters, the autobiographical connections between Anne and Maud Montgomery, and the book's astonishing range of literary, biblical, and mythological references. Additional essays offer fascinating background information on such topics as the geography and settlement of Prince Edward Island where,takes place; the education, orphanages, music, and literature of Anne's time; and the horticulture, homemade artifacts, and food preparation that are so prevalent in the story. Margaret Anne Doody supplies a comprehensive introduction, which situates the novel in its literary and social contexts, explores those aspects of Montgomery's life most relevant to the story, examines revisions in the manuscripts, and provides an overall sense of both the impulses that drove Montgomery to write,,and the larger concerns it dramatizes so compellingly. This edition also contains a chronology of Montgomery's life, an extensive bibliography, songs and poems that appear in the text, and a selection of original reviews of the book. This wealth of material enables readers to grasp the marvelous multi-layeredness of the novel and to understand more fully its place in both its own time and in ours.,Elegantly and beautifully designed, with generous illustrations from previous editions, photographs of the places the novel inhabits, and explanatory drawings that reproduce the texture of Anne's world,,is a major event in the publishing history of one of the world's most charming stories.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Classics,Fiction,Young Adult,Childrens,Historical,Historical Fiction,Childrens,Middle Grade,Historical,Audiobook,Cultural,Canada,Young Adult,Coming Of Age","Marilla Cuthbert,Matthew Cuthbert,Diana Barry,Gilbert Blythe,Rachel Lynde,Anne Shirley,Jane Andrews,Ruby Gillis,Josie Pye,Prissy Andrews,Mr. Phillips,Mrs. Allan","Avonlea, Prince Edward Island,Prince Edward Island",English,August 28th 1997,4.26

Amidst a Weimar-era milieu of silent film stars, artists, and aspirants, Nabokov creates a merciless masterwork as Albinus, an aging critic, falls prey to his own desires, to his teenage mistress, and to Axel Rex, the scheming rival for her affections who finds his greatest joy in the downfall of others. Published first in Russian as Kamera Obskura in 1932, this book appeared in Nabokov's own English translation six years later.

The title refers to a form of navigation he resorted to as a first mate in the Navy during World War II. As he says, \As I was writing this account of my life and times since \Palimpsest,\ I felt as if I were again dealing with those capes and rocks in the Bering Sea that we had to navigate so often with a compass made inoperable by weather.\ It is a beautifully apt analogy for the hazards mostly eluded during his eventful life and for the way this memoir proceeds--far from linear but always on course.,From his desks in Ravello and the Hollywood Hills, Gore Vidal travels in memory through the arenas of literature, television, film, theater, politics and international society where he has cut a broad swath, recounting achievements and defeats, friends and enemies made and on a number of occasions lost. Among the gathering of notables to be found in these pages, sketched with a draftsman's ease and evoked with the panache of one of our great raconteurs, are Jack and Jacqueline Kennedy, Tennessee Williams the \Glorious Bird\, Eleanor Roosevelt, Orson Welles, Johnny Carson, Greta Garbo, Federico Fellini, Rudolph Nureyev, Elia Kazan, and Francis Ford Coppola. Some of the book's most moving pages are devoted to the illness and death of his partner of five decades, Howard Austen, and indeed the book is, among other things, a meditation on mortality written in the spirit of Montaigne.,Elegiac yet vital and even ornery, \Point to Point Navigation\ is a summing-up of Gore Vidal's time on the planet that manages to be at once supremely entertaining, endlessly provocative, and thoroughly moving.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Autobiography,Memoir,Nonfiction,Biography,Biography,Autobiography,History,Politics,Audiobook,Literature,21st Century,Literature,American,LGBT","Abraham Lincoln,Julian the Apostate,Bill Clinton,Mark Twain,F.

In Gore Vidal's Lincoln we meet Lincoln the man and Lincoln the political animal, the president who entered a besieged capital where most of the population supported the South and where even those favoring the Union had serious doubts that the man from Illinois could save it. Far from steadfast in his abhorrence of slavery, Lincoln agonizes over the best course of action and comes to his great decision only when all else seems to fail. As the Civil War ravages his nation, Lincoln must face deep personal turmoil, the loss of his dearest son, and the harangues of a wife seen as a traitor for her Southern connections. Brilliantly conceived, masterfully executed, Gore Vidal's Lincoln allows the man to breathe again.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Historical,Historical Fiction,Fiction,Military History,Civil War,Historical,Politics,North American Hi...,American History,Literature,Politics,Presidents,Literature,American,Novels","Abraham Lincoln,Walt Whitman,William H.

With their broad canvas and large cast of fictional and historical characters, the novels in this series present a panorama of the American political and imperial experience as interpreted by one of its most worldly, knowing, and ironic observers.,Burr is a portrait of perhaps the most complex and misunderstood of the Founding Fathers. In 1804, while serving as vice president, Aaron Burr fought a duel with his political nemesis, Alexander Hamilton, and killed him. In 1807, he was arrested, tried, and acquitted of treason. In 1833, Burr is newly married, an aging statesman considered a monster by many. Burr retains much of his political influence if not the respect of all. And he is determined to tell his own story. As his amanuensis, he chooses Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler, a young New York City journalist, and together they explore both Burr's past and the continuing political intrigues of the still young United States.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Historical,Historical Fiction,Fiction,Politics,North American Hi...,American History,Historical,Novels,Literature,American,Literature,Military History,American Revolution,Classics",Aaron Burr,United States of America,English,February 15th 2000,4.08

Gerade hat er eine Reihe besonders grausamer Morde aufzuklären, bei denen es selbst erfahrenen Polizisten kalt den Rücken hinunterläuft. Einen alten Mann findet man in einer Pfahlgrube aufgespießt, einen anderen halbverhungert, beinahe nackt an einen Baum gebunden und erwürgt. Ein dritter wurde in einem mit Steinen beschwerten Sack in einem See ertränkt. Der eine schrieb Gedichte und war Vogelliebhaber, der andere besaß einen Blumenladen und hatte sich auf Orchideen spezialisiert, der dritte war Forscher an der Universität. Warum verfolgt der Mörder harmlose Bürger mit so brutaler Gewalt? Und warum legt er Wert darauf, dass man die sadistische Grausamkeit seiner Verbrechen sofort bemerkt? Wallanders kluge Devise heißt: \Die Menschen sind selten das, was man von ihnen denkt.\ Und er macht eine verstörende Entdeckung: Alle Opfer waren selbst rücksichtslose, brutale Männer, die Frauen körperlich und seelisch misshandelten. Wenn aber der Mord die Rache des Opfers an den Mördern und Vergewaltigern ist, muss Wallander sich beeilen, bevor das nächste, noch grausamere Verbrechen geschieht.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Mystery,Mystery,Crime,Fiction,Thriller,Cultural,Sweden,European Literature,Scandinavian Literature,Mystery,Detective,Thriller,Mystery Thriller,Scandinavian Lite...,Nordic Noir,European Literature,Swedish Literature","Kurt Wallander,Linda Wallander,Ann-Britt Höglund,Holger Eriksson,Magnus Martinsson,Karl Svedberg,Nyberg,Per Åkeson,Gösta Runfeldt,Vanja Andersson,Lisa Holgersson,Katarina Taxell",Skåne,German,October 2000,4.03

In this groundbreaking book, veteran science correspondent Fred Pearce focuses on the dire state of the world's rivers to provide our most complete portrait yet of the growing world water crisis and its ramifications for us all.,Pearce traveled to more than thirty countries while researching,examining the current state of crucial water sources like the Indus River in Pakistan, the Colorado River in the United States, and the Yellow and Yangzte rivers in China. Pearce deftly weaves together the complicated scientific, economic, and historic dimensions of the water crisis, showing us its complex origins-from waste to wrong-headed engineering projects to high-yield crop varieties that have saved developing countries from starvation but are now emptying their water reserves. He reveals the most daunting water issues we face today, among them the threat of flooding in China's Yellow River, where rising silt levels will prevent dykes from containing floodwaters; the impoverishment of Pakistan's Sindh, a once-fertile farming valley now destroyed by the 14 million tons of salt that the much-depleted Indus deposits annually on the land but cannot remove; the disappearing Colorado River, whose reservoirs were once the lifeblood of seven states but which could dry up as soon as 2007; and the poisoned springs of Palestine and the Jordan River, where Israeli control of the water supply has only fed conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.,The situation is dire, but not without remedy. Pearce argues that the solution to the growing worldwide water shortage is not more and bigger dams but greater efficiency and a new water ethic based on managing the water cycle for maximum social benefit rather than narrow self-interest.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Nonfiction,Environment,Science,Environment,Sustainability,History,Environment,Nature,Science,Geography,Politics,Environment,Climate Change,Biology,Ecology","Saparmurat Niyazov,Mao Zedong,Pliny the Elder,James Wolfensohn,Dai Qing,Daniel Rosenfeld,Bob Schemenauer,Andrew Parker,Michael Evenari","Pakistan,Rio Grande Valley, Texas,El Paso, Texas,Juarez,Texas,Mexico,Ojinaga,Kushkal, Gujarat,Tirupur,Plachimara, Keraia,Sahara Desert,Hirapur,Tilaipani, Madhya Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh,Tamil Nadu,Bangladesh,Dipordi,Oklahoma,Kansas,California,Saudi Arabia,Gaza,Isle of Ely,Ely,Kent, England,Sudan,Sudd,Paraguay,Botswana,Okavango delta,Namibia,Angola,Lake Chad,Nigeria,Sahel,Afghanistan,Helmand Province,Iran,Iran, Islamic Republic of,Cambodia,Mekong River,China,Yellow River,Tibetan plateau,Tibet,Shandong Province,Shanxi Province,Ninxia Province,Gansu Province,Inner Mongolia,Taiyuan, Shanxi Province,Hohhot, Inner Mongolia,Loess Plateau,Ghana,Sri Lanka,Nagaragawa,Lake Mead,Colorado River, Utah,Yangtze River,Amazon River,Mozambique,Tegucigalpa,Honduras,Burkina Faso,Hidalgo State,Golan Heights,West Bank,Israel,Palestine,Jordan River Valley,Kashmir,Indus River,Sumer,Angkor,Guatemala,Arizona,Arizona Desert,Phoenix, Arizona,Lake Powell, Utah,Yuma, Arizona,Aral Sea,Kazakhstan,Uzbekistan,Turkmenistan,Karakalpakstan,Australia,Murray River,New South Wales,South Downs, England,Sussex, England,Canada,Idaho,Snowy Mountains,Karnataka State,Morocco,Devon, England,North Dakota,Tampa Bay, Florida,Santa Cruz, California,Negev Desert,Machakos District,Shallalah Saghirah,Syrian Arab Republic,Cyprus,Baluchistan State,Crimea,Feodosia,Libya,Lynmouth, Devon, England,Wiltshire, England,Jericho,Canterbury, Kent, England",English,March 1st 2006,3.95

Like Salman Rushdie, Bharati Mukherjee, and Chitra Divakaruni, Roy is fascinated by the collision of the ancient and modern in India -- the age-old class hatreds and bigotry that continue to thrive beneath roofs studded with satellite dishes. And like those writers, she is expert at limning the territory of cultural dislocation. Roy's achievement lies in her ability to explore this dislocation through the ebbing fortunes of one particular Indian family. The story of the privileged yet doomed Kochammas is in many ways a miniaturized tale of India itself, a country in which, as Roy states, \misfortune is always relative,\ a country in which personal turmoil is dwarfed by the \vast, violent, insane public turmoil of a nation.\,P,The novel opens with the return of Rahel Kochamma to her home in the southwest Indian province of Kerala 23 years after the drowning of her eight-year-old cousin, Sophie. Rahel has returned to see her twin brother, Estha, who was abruptly sent away in the aftermath of Sophie's death; he has himself only recently returned, rendered literally silent by that long-ago trauma. The landscape Rahel walks through is fecund and dank: \Boundaries blur as tapioca fences take root and bloom. Brick walls turn mossgreen. Pepper vines snake up electric poles. Wild creepers burst through laterite banks. Black crows gorge on bright mangoes.\ The riotous imagery is intentional: the monsoon air causes \locked windows to burst open,\ and \strange insects to appear...like ideas in the evenings.\ The sense of secrets about to burst, of tenuous bonds about to snap, pervades the narrative. The once-prosperous family Rahel is returning to they used to own a thriving pickle factory has been decimated: Rahel and Estha's mother, Ammu, is dead; their grief-stricken Marxist uncle, Chacko, a Rhodes scholar, has emigrated to Canada; Mammachi, their grandmother, is also dead. The only one that remains is their grand-aunt Baby Kochamma, whose obsessive love for gardening has been supplanted by a newfound passion for televised NBA tournaments and \Bold and the Beautiful\ reruns. Seeing her seated in her turmeric-stained nightgown, swinging her puffy, tiny, manicured feet, it is hard to imagine the damage Baby wreaked on the twins so many years earlier.,P,It is to Roy's credit that the story that eventually surfaces of Baby's own past, including her unrequited love for a Benedictine monk, explains her actions while never excusing them. Indeed, the histories of all the members of the Kochamma clan -- unconventional, mysterious Ammu; Pappachi, the twins' grandfather, an accomplished but unacknowledged entomologist; Velutha, the gifted yet doomed untouchable -- are so fully portrayed that it is impossible to see even the most heinous among them as guilty. We see their foibles, dreams, weaknesses, and fury; we see them, in short, within the context of their own histories, and within the larger context of their position within Indian society. Wisely, Roy lets the fragments of their stories emerge gradually. Shifting back and forth through time, Roy circles the events of that summer slowly, all the while tightening the noose of her narrative. If the effect is occasionally chaotic, like the jumbled colors of a kaleidoscope before a pattern clicks into place, the complexity of Roy's mosaic redeems her.,P,A dazzling way with language doesn't hurt, either. In the humid atmosphere she has created, language itself seems to have twisted and exploded. Roy doesn't hesitate to make up words when ordinary ones don't suffice. Hence afternoon nightmares are called \aftermares,\ and fat Uncle Chacko's suit grows \less bursty\ as he turns shy in front of the daughter he has not seen in several years. Odd yet compelling images abound: A house wears its steep gabled roof \pulled low over its ears, like a low hat.\ Bright plastic bags blow across the river bordering their home like \subtropical flying-flowers.\,P,iThe God of Small Things/i isn't just about a summer when two children's innocence -- and a third's life -- is lost. It is about a country in which, as Roy states, \various kinds of despair compete for primacy.\ While exploring societal taboos and the often fatal consequences for those who disregard them, Roy, through the relationship between Estha and Rahel, also explores the limits of loyalty and the essential \Law-lessness\ of love. In linking the political turmoil of India to the members of this extraordinary family, Roy has offered us a radically new history, a world so deeply imagined that it -- like the best of fictions -- reads as truth. The ability to touch and be touched, Roy knows, lies beyond legislation.,P#151;Sarah Midori Zimmerman","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Cultural,India,Historical,Historical Fiction,Contemporary,Novels,Asian Literature,Indian Literature,Literary Fiction,Literature,Classics,Cultural,Asia","Rahel,Ammu,Mammachi,Chacko,Estha,Velutha,Baby Kochamma","Kerala,Aymanam",English,June 1st 1998,3.94

Pensaba que los libros de caballerías tenían una mala influencia. Hizo esta crítica también porque en esta época Renacimiento había un espíritu crítico y humanista.,Uno de los rasgos típicos del estilo del Quijote es el humor que se dirige a los lectores de los libros.

Testing themselves against treacherous currents, braving depths that induced hallucinatory effects, navigating through wreckage as perilous as a minefield, they pushed themselves to their limits and beyond, brushing against death more than once in the rusting hulks of sunken ships.,But in the fall of 1991, not even these courageous divers were prepared for what they found 230 feet below the surface, in the frigid Atlantic waters sixty miles off the coast of New Jersey: a World War II German U-boat, its ruined interior a macabre wasteland of twisted metal, tangled wires, and human bones–all buried under decades of accumulated sediment.,No identifying marks were visible on the submarine or the few artifacts brought to the surface. No historian, expert, or government had a clue as to which U-boat the men had found. In fact, the official records all agreed that there simply could not be a sunken U-boat and crew at that location.,Over the next six years, an elite team of divers embarked on a quest to solve the mystery. Some of them would not live to see its end. Chatterton and Kohler, at first bitter rivals, would be drawn into a friendship that deepened to an almost mystical sense of brotherhood with each other and with the drowned U-boat sailors–former enemies of their country. As the men’s marriages frayed under the pressure of a shared obsession, their dives grew more daring, and each realized that he was hunting more than the identities of a lost U-boat and its nameless crew.,Author Robert Kurson’s account of this quest is at once thrilling and emotionally complex, and it is written with a vivid sense of what divers actually experience when they meet the dangers of the ocean’s underworld. The story of Shadow Divers often seems too amazing to be true, but it all happened, two hundred thirty feet down, in the deep blue sea.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Nonfiction,History,Adventure,Biography,Audiobook,War,World War II,War,Mystery,Science,Historical","John Chatterton,Richie Kohler",New Jersey Shore,English,2004,4.31

The ceremony and reception proceed without a hitch–until a crasher appears claiming to be a MacKenna guest. The disheveled and eccentric professor of medieval history warns that there’s “bad blood” between the couple’s clans, stemming from an ancient feud that originated in Scotland, and involving the Buchanan theft of a coveted MacKenna treasure.,Jordan has always led a cautious life and has used her intelligence and reason to become a successful businesswoman. So she is intrigued but skeptical of the professor’s claims that the feud has been kept alive by the grave injustices the Buchanans have perpetrated over the centuries. But when Noah Clayborne, a close family friend and a man who has never let a good time or a pretty girl pass him by, accuses Jordan of being trapped in her comfort zone, she determines to prove him wrong and sets out on a spontaneous adventure to the small, dusty town of Serenity, Texas, to judge the professor’s research for herself.,Maneuvering through a close-knit community in which everyone knows everyone else’s business, Jordan never anticipates the danger and intrigue that lie in her path, nor the threat that will shadow her back to Boston, where even in familiar surroundings, her life is at risk.,A powerful thug who rules by fear, a man who harbors a simmering secret, and an unexpected romance that pierces all defenses–beloved author Julie Garwood weaves these dazzling elements into a brilliant novel of romantic suspense.

Nearly 30 and \rather moth-eaten already,\ a poet whose one small book of verse has fallen \flatter than any pancake,\ Gordon has given up a \good\ job and gone to work in a bookshop at half his former salary. Always broke, but too proud to accept charity, he rarely sees his few friends and cannot get the virginal Rosemary to bed because or so he believes, \If you have no money ... women won't love you.\ On the windowsill of Gordon's shabby rooming-house room is a sickly but unkillable aspidistra--a plant he abhors as the banner of the sort of \mingy, lower-middle-class decency\ he is fleeing in his downward flight.,In,, George Orwell has created a darkly compassionate satire to which anyone who has ever been oppressed by the lack of brass, or by the need to make it, will all too easily relate. He etches the ugly insanity of what Gordon calls \the money-world\ in unflinching detail, but the satire has a second edge, too, and Gordon himself is scarcely heroic. In the course of his misadventures, we become grindingly aware that his radical solution to the problem of the money-world is no solution at all--that in his desperate reaction against a monstrous system, he has become something of a monster himself.,Orwell keeps both of his edges sharp to the very end--a \happy\ ending that poses tough questions about just how happy it really is. That the book itself is not sour, but constantly fresh and frequently funny, is the result of Orwell's steady, unsentimental attention to the telling detail; his dry, quiet humor; his fascination with both the follies and the excellences of his characters; and his courageous refusal to embrace the comforts of any easy answer.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Classics,European Literature,British Literature,Literature,Literature,20th Century,Novels,Literature,English Literature,Literary Fiction,Classics,Modern Classics,Politics","Gordon Comstock,Rosemary Waterlow,Philip Ravelston,Julia Comstock,Hermione Slater,Mrs Wisbeach,Mr Erskine","London, England",English,October 26th 2000,3.89

She leaves her animated, affectionate family in South Bend, Indiana, at least in part because of the boarding school’s glossy brochure, in which boys in sweaters chat in front of old brick buildings, girls in kilts hold lacrosse sticks on pristinely mown athletic fields, and everyone sings hymns in chapel.,As Lee soon learns, Ault is a cloistered world of jaded, attractive teenagers who spend summers on Nantucket and speak in their own clever shorthand. Both intimidated and fascinated by her classmates, Lee becomes a shrewd observer of–and, ultimately, a participant in–their rituals and mores. As a scholarship student, she constantly feels like an outsider and is both drawn to and repelled by other loners. By the time she’s a senior, Lee has created a hard-won place for herself at Ault. But when her behavior takes a self-destructive and highly public turn, her carefully crafted identity within the community is shattered.,Ultimately, Lee’s experiences–complicated relationships with teachers; intense friendships with other girls; an all-consuming preoccupation with a classmate who is less than a boyfriend and more than a crush; conflicts with her parents, from whom Lee feels increasingly distant, coalesce into a singular portrait of the painful and thrilling adolescence universal to us all.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Young Adult,Womens Fiction,Chick Lit,Contemporary,Young Adult,Coming Of Age,School Stories,Boarding School,Adult Fiction,Adult,Novels,Realistic Fiction","Lee Fiora,Cross Sugarman,Martha Porter,Aspeth Montgomery,Dede Schwartz,Sin Jun,Conchita Maxwell,David Bardo,Aubrey","Massachusetts,South Bend, Indiana",English,November 22nd 2005,3.4

Because he was living in Prague and she in Berlin, his courtship was largely an epistolary one--passionate, self-deprecating, and anxious letters sent almost daily, sometimes even two or three times a day. But soon after their engagement was announced in 1914, Kafka began to worry that marriage would interfere with his writing and his need for solitude.,The more than five hundred letters Kafka wrote to Felice--through their breakup, a second engagement in 1917, and their final parting in the fall of that year, when Kafka began to feel the effects of the tuberculosis that would eventually claim his life--reveal the full measure of his inner turmoil as he tried, in vain, to balance his desire for human connection with what he felt were the solitary demands of his craft.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Nonfiction,Biography,Literature,Classics,European Literature,German Literature,Literature,20th Century,Autobiography,Memoir,Biography,Autobiography,Unfinished,Criticism,Literary Criticism",Felice Bauer,Berlin,English,December 6th 2016,4.12

The noise was heard as far away as Holyrood Palace, where Queen Mary was attending a wedding masque. Those arriving at the scene of devastation found, in the garden, the naked corpses of Darnley and his valet. Neither had died in the explosion, but both bodies bore marks of strangulation.,It was clear that they had been murdered and the house destroyed in an attempt to obliterate the evidence. Darnley was not a popular king-consort, but he was regarded by many as having a valid claim to the English throne. For this reason Elizabeth I had opposed his family's longstanding wish to marry him to Mary Stuart, who herself claimed to be the rightful queen of England.,Alison Weir's investigation of Darnley's murder is set against one of the most dramatic periods in British history. Her conclusions shed a brilliant new light on the actions and motives of the conspirators and, in particular, the extent of Mary's own involvement.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,History,Nonfiction,Biography,Historical,Cultural,Scotland,English History,Tudor Period,European Literature,British Literature,Crime,True Crime,Literature,16th Century,History,European History","Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley,Mary, Queen of Scots",Scotland,English,February 5th 2004,4.05

Devious, naïve, often highly principled, beautiful, and sexually voracious, this was a woman who secured the Scottish throne and bolstered the position of the Catholic Church in Scotland. Her endless plotting, including a likely involvement in the murder of her husband Lord Darnley, eventually led to her flight from Scotland and imprisonment by her equally ambitions cousin and fellow queen, Elizabeth of England. And yet when Elizabeth ordered her unpredictable rival and kinswoman to be beheaded in 1587 she did so in resigned frustration rather than as act of political wrath.Was the beheading of a cousin truly necessary? Did Mary, though churlish, petulant, and often disloyal, really deserve to forfeit the compassion of her cousin, a woman who from childhood had been her friend and playmate? Mary’s fate was to be born to supreme power, but she was totally lacking in the political ability to deal with its responsibilities. This was the tragedy that turned her life into a study in failure. The extraordinary story of Mary, which has inspired the great poets, playwrights, and operatic composers of the 19th and 20th centuries, is one of the most colorful and emotionally searing tales of western history, and is here told by a leading specialist of the 16th century.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,History,Nonfiction,Biography,Historical","Mary, Queen of Scots",Scotland,English,May 4th 2001,3.69

Yet when his daughter is born, he sees immediately that she has Down's Syndrome. Rationalizing it as a need to protect Norah, his wife, he makes a split-second decision that will alter all of their lives forever. He asks his nurse to take the baby away to an institution and never to reveal the secret. But Caroline, the nurse, cannot leave the infant. Instead, she disappears into another city to raise the child herself. So begins this story that unfolds over a quarter of a century - in which these two families, ignorant of each other, are yet bound by the fateful decision made that long-ago winter night. Norah Henry, who knows only that her daughter died at birth, remains inconsolable; her grief weighs heavily on their marriage. And Paul, their son, raises himself as best he can, in a house grown cold with mourning. Meanwhile, Phoebe, the lost daughter, grows from a sunny child to a vibrant young woman whose mother loves her as fiercely as if she were her own.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Contemporary,Adult Fiction,Adult,Historical,Historical Fiction,Book Club,Drama,Womens Fiction,Chick Lit,Novels,Family","Phoebe,Al,Dr. David Henry,Norah Henry,Bree,Paul Henry","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,Lexington, Kentucky,Paris",English,May 30th 2006,3.68

His efforts to complete the project, and the fair's incredible success, are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody, Susan B. Anthony, and Thomas Edison.,The activities of the sinister Dr. Holmes, who is believed to be responsible for scores of murders around the time of the fair, are equally remarkable. He devised and erected the World's Fair Hotel, complete with crematorium and gas chamber, near the fairgrounds and used the event as well as his own charismatic personality to lure victims.,Combining the stories of an architect and a killer in one book, mostly in alternating chapters, seems like an odd choice but it works. The magical appeal and horrifying dark side of 19th-century Chicago are both revealed through Larson's skillful writing. - John Moe","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Nonfiction,History,Crime,True Crime,Mystery,Crime,Historical,Mystery,Audiobook,North American Hi...,American History,Biography,Book Club","Daniel Burnham,H.H.

As cartas estão todas endereçadas a \Meu caro e desventurado sucessor\, e fazem mergulhar em um mundo com o qual ela nunca sonhou - um labirinto onde os segredos do passado de seu pai e o misterioso destino de sua mãe convergem para um mal inconcebível escondido nas profundezas da história.,As cartas fazem alusão a um dos poderes mais maléficos que a humanidade jamais conheceu, e a uma busca secular pela origem desse mal e sua erradicação. É uma caça à verdade sobre Vlad, o Empalador, o governante medieval cujo bárbaro reinado gerou a lenda de Drácula. Gerações de historiadores arriscaram reputação, sanidade, e até mesmo as próprias vidas para conhecer essa verdade. Agora, uma jovem precisa decidir continuar ou não essa busca - e seguir seu pai em uma caçada que quase o levou à ruína anos antes, quando ele era um estudante universitário cheio de energia e sua mãe ainda era viva.,O que a lenda de Vlad, o Empalador tem a ver com o mundo moderno? Será possível que o Drácula mítico tenha realmente existido - e continuado a viver, pelos séculos afora? A resposta a estas perguntas atravessa o tempo e as fronteiras enquanto primeiro o pai, e depois a filha perseguem pistas que os levam de empoeiradas bibliotecas de universidades norte-americanas a Istambul, Budapeste e os confins da Europa oriental. Em cada cidade, monastério e arquivo, em cartas e conversas secretas, emerge a horrível verdade sobre o feroz reinado de Vlad - e sobre um pacto atemporal que pode ter mantido sua monstruosa obra viva através dos tempos.,Juntando indícios escondidos e textos até então desconhecidos, e interpretando as mensagens em código enredadas na trama das tradições monásticas medievais - bem como esquivando-se dos adversários que farão de tudo para proteger os milenares poderes de Vlad -, uma mulher desvenda o segredo de seu passado e enfrenta a própria definição do mal. O Historiador é uma aventura de proporções monumentais, uma narrativa incansável que mistura fato e fantasia, passado e presente, em um estilo de suspense quase intolerável - e impossível de esquecer.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction,Fantasy,Horror,Mystery,Paranormal,Vampires,Historical,Fantasy,Paranormal,Gothic,Thriller","Bartholomew Rossi,Helen Rossi,Dracula","Europe,Amsterdam",Portuguese,August 19th 2005,3.78

An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes,Benjamin Franklin is the Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his new-fangled spectacles. By bringing Franklin to life, Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours.,He was, during his 84-year life, America's best scientist, inventor, diplomat, writer, and business strategist, and he was also one of its most practical—though not most profound—political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity, and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances, local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation's federal compromise. He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union, the Declaration of Independence, the treaty of alliance with France, the peace treaty with England, and the Constitution. And he helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor, democratic values, and philosophical pragmatism.,But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually reinvented, was himself. America's first great publicist, he was, in his life and in his writings, consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process, he carefully crafted his own persona, portrayed it in public, and polished it for posterity.,Through it all, he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow \leather-aprons\ more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength, not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a \dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people.\ Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully, and none so intuitively.,In this colorful and intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life, from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman, scientist, and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson, his practical marriage, and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty-first century.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Biography,History,Nonfiction,North American Hi...,American History,Biography Memoir,Politics,Military History,American Revolution,Historical,Audiobook,Business",Benjamin Franklin,United States of America,English,June 2004,4.0

Tall, blond, and handsome, Jack was once a beloved teacher and soccer coach at a girls' prep school -- until a student's crush sparked a powder keg of accusation and robbed him of his reputation. Now, working for minimum wage washing dishes for Addie Peabody at the Do-Or-Diner, Jack buries his past, content to become the mysterious stranger who has appeared out of the blue.,With ghosts of her own haunting her, Addie Peabody is as cautious around men as Jack St. Bride is around women.

Amid the white-painted centuries-old churches, a quartet of bored, privileged teenage girls have formed a coven that is crossing the line between amusement and malicious intent. Quick to notice the attractive new employee at Addie's diner, the girls turn Jack's world upside down with a shattering allegation that causes history to repeat itself -- and forces Jack to proclaim his innocence once again. Suddenly nothing in Salem Falls is as it seems: a safe haven turns dangerous, an innocent girl meets evil face-to-face, a dishwasher with a Ph.D. is revealed to be an ex-con. As Jack's hidden past catches up with him, the seams of this tiny town begin to tear, and the emerging truth becomes a slippery concept written in shades of gray.

In the characters and their circumstances details of Joyce's life are evident. The main character, Richard Rowan, the moody, tormented writer who is at odds with both his wife and the parochial Irish society around him, is clearly a portrait of Joyce himself. The character of Rowan's wife, Bertha, is certainly influenced by Joyce's lover and later wife, Nora Barnacle, with whom he left Ireland and lived a seminomadic existence in Zurich, Rome, Trieste, and Paris. As in real life, the play depicts the couple with a young son and, like Joyce, Rowan has returned to Ireland because of his mother's illness and subsequent death.,One can also detect hints of Joyce's interest in Nietzsche in Rowan's flawed pursuit of total individual freedom despite the stifling morals of Irish society. Though wrestling with guilt over his own infidelities, Rowan insists on this personal liberty, not only for himself but for his wife as well, who he knows is tempted by his cousin's amorous overtures.,Joyce's decision to express himself in the form of a play no doubt reflects his long admiration of the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. In the tense dialogue, the largely interior drama focused on the characters' relationships, the undertones of guilt, and the longing for freedom one sees similarities with Ibsen's themes. Also the spare, understated writing style - so unlike Joyce's exuberant, playful, and experimental use of language in his novels - shows the influence of Ibsen's \naked drama\ as Joyce described Ibsen's style in a published review. Above all, Joyce emulated the Scandinavian master in making the central issue of his drama the conflict between individual freedom and a demanding, judgmental society. In Exiles the protagonists struggle with the choice between living in defiance of the rigid conventions of Irish society or exile from their homeland.,Though lesser-known, Exiles, written after Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and while Joyce was working on Ulysses, provides interesting insights into the development of the creative gifts of a literary genius.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Plays,Drama,European Literature,Irish Literature,Fiction,Cultural,Ireland,Classics,Plays,Theatre,Literature,20th Century,Literature,Literary Fiction","Richard Rowan,Bertha Rowan,Archie Rowan,Robert Hand,Beatrice Justice,Brigid, an old servant of the Rowan family,A Fishwoman",Dublin,English,2003,3.4

King wrote the book during a period of acknowledged substance abuse & has written that he realized later on that the novel was a metaphor for that addiction.,The writer & critic Kim Newman has cited another influence on the novel, saying that in it King had \more or less rewritten,,\ a 1950s BBC television science-fiction serial.

On the twenty-fourth morning after the decampment of his wife, Patty Lareine, he awakens with a hangover, considerable sexual excitement, and, on his upper arm, a red tattoo bearing a name from the past. Of the night before, he remembers practically nothing. What he soon learns is that the front passenger seat of his Porsche is soaked with blood and that in a secluded corner of his marijuana stash in a nearby woods rests a blonde head, severed at the throat.,Is Madden therefore a murderer? He has no way of knowing. As in many novels of crime, the narrative centers on violence--physical, sexual, and emotional--but these elements move in their orbits through a rich constellation of character as Madden tries to reconstruct the missing hours of a terrible evening. In the course of this in-quiry a bizarre and vividly etched gallery of characters reappears to him as in a dream--ex-prizefighters, sexual junkies, mediums, former cons, a police chief, a world-weary former girl friend, and Mad-den's father, old now but still a Herculean figure, a practitioner of the sternest backroom ethics.,\Tough Guys Don't Dance\ represents Mailer at the peak of his powers with a stunningly conceived novel that soon transcends its origins as a mystery to become a relentless search into the recesses and buried virtues of the modern American male. Rarely, as many readers will discern, have the paradoxes ofmachismo and homosexuality been so well explored.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Mystery,Novels,Literature,Mystery,Crime,Literature,American,Thriller,Roman,Classics,Contemporary",Tim Madden,"Provincetown, Massachusetts",English,September 10th 2002,3.5

By the time author Alan Paton died, more than 15 million copies of his extraordinary novel had been sold. Searching for the son he has not seen for many months, a Zulu pastor takes the train to Johannesburg. In his heart are growing fears - fears of the unknown, fear of the great city that kills the soul of innocent children, fear of being alone in a world where he no longer belongs, and fear of never finding his son. But unfaltering courage and simple faith lead him through a country now alien to him, past people to whom he is invisible, looking for answers to the questions that haunt him. What is justice? What is freedom? Where is hope?

According to Chomsky, \propaganda is to democracy as the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state,\ and the mass media is the primary vehicle for delivering propaganda in the United States. From an examination of how Woodrow Wilson’s Creel Commission \succeeded, within six months, in turning a pacifist population into a hysterical, war-mongering population,\ to Bush Sr.'s war on Iraq, Chomsky examines how the mass media and public relations industries have been used as propaganda to generate public support for going to war. Chomsky further touches on how the modern public relations industry has been influenced by Walter Lippmann’s theory of \spectator democracy,\ in which the public is seen as a \bewildered herd\ that needs to be directed, not empowered; and how the public relations industry in the United States focuses on \controlling the public mind,\ and not on informing it. Media Control is an invaluable primer on the secret workings of disinformation in democratic societies.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Politics,Nonfiction,Philosophy,History,Sociology,Culture,Society,Psychology,Writing,Journalism,Literature,American,Politics,Political Science","John F.

The town is important because it is a port that serves a large coal mine. Colonel Lanser, the head of the invading battalion, along with his staff establishes his HQ in the house of the democratically elected and popular Mayor Orden.,As the reality of occupation sinks in and the weather turns bleak, with the snows beginning earlier than usual, the \simple, peaceful people\ of the town are angry and confused. Colonel Lanser, a veteran of many wars, tries to operate under a veil of civility and law, but in his heart he knows that \there are no peaceful people\ amongst those whose freedom has been taken away by force. The veil is soon torn apart when Alexander Morden, an erstwhile alderman and \a free man,\ is ordered to work in the mine. He strikes out at Captain Loft with a pick axe, but Captain Bentick steps into its path and dies of it. After a summary trial, Morden is executed by a firing squad. This incident catalyzes the people of the town and they settle into \a slow, silent, waiting revenge.\ Sections of the railroad linking the port with the mine get damaged regularly, the machinery breaks down often, and the dynamo of the electricity generators gets short circuited. Whenever a soldier relaxes his guard, drinks or goes out with a woman, he is killed. Mayor Orden stands by his people, and tries to explain to Col. Lanser that his goal – \to break man’s spirit permanently\ – is impossible.,The cold weather and the constant fear weighs heavy on the occupying force, many of whom wish the war to end so that they can return home. They realize the futility of the war and that \the flies have conquered the flypaper.\ Some members of the resistance escape to England and ask the English for explosives so that the townspeople can intensify their efforts. English planes parachute-drop small packages containing dynamite sticks and chocolates all around the town. In a state of panic, the army takes the Mayor and his friend Dr. Winter, the town doctor and historian, hostage and lets it be known that any action from resistance will lead to their execution. Mayor Orden knows that nothing can stop his people and that his death is imminent. He tells his wife that while he can be killed, the idea of Mayor and freedom and democracy is beyond the reach of any army. Before his execution, Mayor Orden reminds Dr. Winter of the dialogues of Socrates in the Apology, a part he played in the high school play, and tells him to make sure that the debt is repaid to the army, i.e., that the resistance is continued.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Classics,Historical,Historical Fiction,War,Literature,Literature,American,Novels,War,World War II,Historical,Literary Fiction","Mayor Orden,Doctor Winter,Sarah Orden,George Corell,Alex Morden,Molly Morden,Joseph The Moon is Down,Annie The Moon Is Down,Colonel Lanser,Captain Bentick,Captain Loft,Lieutenant Prackle,Lieutenant Tonder",Norway,English,November 30th 2000,3.9

He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean, moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine—differences of race, of age, of cultural background—that one should not, perhaps, be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer, Iago, who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago's insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful, fascination—which dominates the early acts of the play—turns to horror, especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago's schemes; of an innocent Desdemona, who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults, the outcome of Othello's mistaken convictions about her faithlessness.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Classics,Plays,Fiction,Drama,Academic,School,Literature,Plays,Theatre,Academic,Read For School,Poetry,Tragedy","Iago,Bianca,Othello,Miguel Cássio,Desdêmona,Emilia,Rodrigo","Venice,Cyprus",English,January 1st 2004,3.9

None of the gritty darkness or frenzied action is lost in 1st to Die, although the female protagonists offer an even deeper emotional context to this suspense thriller.,Inspector Lindsay Boxer of the San Francisco Police Department suddenly finds herself in the middle of two horrifying situations: The first is that she's just learned she has an often-fatal blood disease. The second is a double homicide case she is now heading up that involves the murder of newlyweds on their wedding night. Burdened with Chris Raleigh, a new partner reassigned from the mayor's office, Lindsay finds that she has too much to deal with and turns to her best friend, Claire, the head ME on the case. Claire offers helpful advice and human, friendly contact amid a job filled with violence, cruelty, and fear.,Soon a fledgling newspaper reporter, Cindy, makes contact with Lindsay looking for a career-making story. Although Lindsay can't officially comment on the case, the two women form a rapport, and Cindy joins Lindsay and Claire for their weekly meeting. When a second pair of newlyweds is murdered, and later a third, the investigation leads to a prominent crime writer, Nicholas Jenks, who has a history of spousal abuse and a predilection for kinky, dangerous sex games. With the help of an understanding assistant D.A., Jill Bernhardt, Lindsay tries to make a case against Jenks, who even had an affair with one of the slain women. Eventually Jill joins the Murder Club, and the four ladies share private interdepartmental information in an effort to track and stop the killer before he strikes again.,The major subplot -- Lindsay's facing up to her illness even while she learns to fall in love again -- carefully compensates for the novel's coarse scenes of brutality. Lindsay Boxer is't merely an obsessed cop trailing a maniac; she's also a terrified woman confronting the onslaught of disease. The story lines balance out to show us the true mettle of someone who puts the safety of others before her own.,Again, Patterson's skill for producing furiously paced fiction are evident as the novel breezes by rapidly. The short chapters keep the narrative leaping with increasingly taut plot elements, but there's an emotional commitment that makes our protagonist even more amiable and involving. 1st to Die is a novel that works as an intense series of character portraits that will leave the reader touched and delighted.,--Tom Piccirilli","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Mystery,Fiction,Mystery,Crime,Thriller,Thriller,Mystery Thriller,Suspense,Mystery,Murder Mystery,Audiobook,Mystery,Detective,Adult","Lindsay Boxer,Claire Washburn,Jill Bernhardt,Cindy Thomas,Warren Jacobi","San Francisco, California",English,May 20th 2005,4.08

She has created a world so thoroughly enchanting that eight hundred pages leave readers longing for more.,English magicians were once the wonder of the known world, with fairy servants at their beck and call; they could command winds, mountains, and woods. But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long, dull papers about it, while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory.,But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire, the rich, reclusive Mr Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England's magical past and regained some of the powers of England's magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte, creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French.,All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative-the very opposite of Mr Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington's army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician, Mr Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Mr Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fantasy,Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction,Historical,Fantasy,Magic,Science Fiction Fantasy,Science Fiction,Alternate History,Audiobook,Adult,Magical Realism","Jonathan Strange,Gilbert Norrell,George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron,John Uskglass The Raven King,John Childermass,Vinculus,Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool,Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington,Stephen Black,John Segundus,Mr. Honeyfoot,Mrs. Honeyfoot,Christopher Drawlight,Henry Lascelles,Jeremy Johns,Arabella Woodhope Strange,Laurence Strange,Sir Walter Pole,Lady Emma Wintertowne Pole,Henry Woodhope,John Hyde,Dr. Lancelot Greysteel,Louisa Greysteel,Flora Greysteel,Mrs Delgado,Napoleon Bonaparte",United Kingdom,English,August 1st 2006,3.82

Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep.,J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on,'s 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Classics,Fiction,Young Adult,Literature,Academic,School,Novels,Young Adult,Coming Of Age,Young Adult,High School,Literature,American,Academic,Read For School","Holden Caulfield,Robert Ackley,Stradlater,Phoebe Caulfield,Allie Caulfield,D.B Caulfield,Sally Hayes,Holden Caufield,Robert Ackley,Stradlater,Phoebe Caulfield,Allie Caulfield,D.B Caulfield,Sally Hayes","New York City, New York,Agerstown, Pennsylvania",English,December 1st 1999,3.81

Tall, blond, and handsome, Jack was once a beloved teacher and soccer coach at a girls' prep school -- until a student's crush sparked a powder keg of accusation and robbed him of his reputation. Now, working for minimum wage washing dishes for Addie Peabody at the Do-Or-Diner, Jack buries his past, content to become the mysterious stranger who has appeared out of the blue.,With ghosts of her own haunting her, Addie Peabody is as cautious around men as Jack St. Bride is around women. But as this unassuming stranger steps smoothly into the diner's daily routine, she finds him fitting just as comfortably inside her heart -- and slowly, a gentle, healing love takes hold between them.,Yet planting roots in Salem Falls may prove fateful for Jack. Amid the white-painted centuries-old churches, a quartet of bored, privileged teenage girls have formed a coven that is crossing the line between amusement and malicious intent. Quick to notice the attractive new employee at Addie's diner, the girls turn Jack's world upside down with a shattering allegation that causes history to repeat itself -- and forces Jack to proclaim his innocence once again. Suddenly nothing in Salem Falls is as it seems: a safe haven turns dangerous, an innocent girl meets evil face-to-face, a dishwasher with a Ph.D. is revealed to be an ex-con.

It is the beginning of Lent: the traditional season of self-denial. The priest says she’ll be out of business by Easter.,To make matters worse, Vianne does not go to church and has a penchant for superstition. Like her mother, she can read Tarot cards. But she begins to win over customers with her smiles, her intuition for everyone’s favourites, and her delightful confections. Her shop provides a place, too, for secrets to be whispered, grievances aired. She begins to shake up the rigid morality of the community. Vianne’s plans for an Easter Chocolate Festival divide the whole community. Can the solemnity of the Church compare with the pagan passion of a chocolate éclair?,For the first time, here is a novel in which chocolate enjoys its true importance, emerging as an agent of transformation. Rich, clever, and mischievous, reminiscent of a folk tale or fable, this is a triumphant read with a memorable character at its heart.,Says Harris: “You might see [Vianne] as an archetype or a mythical figure. I prefer to see her as the lone gunslinger who blows into the town, has a showdown with the man in the black hat, then moves on relentless. But on another level she is a perfectly real person with real insecurities and a very human desire for love and acceptance. Her qualities too - kindness, love, tolerance - are very human.” Vianne and her young daughter Anouk, come into town on Shrove Tuesday. “Carnivals make us uneasy,” says Harris, “because of what they represent: the residual memory of blood sacrifice it is after all from the word \carne\ that the term arises, of pagan celebration. And they represent a loss of inhibition; carnival time is a time at which almost anything is possible.”,The book became an international best-seller, and was optioned to film quickly. The Oscar-nominated movie, with its star-studded cast including Juliette Binoche , and Judi Dench ,, was directed by Lasse Hallstrom, whose previous film,based on a John Irving novel also looks at issues of community and moral standards, though in a less lighthearted vein.,The idea for the book came from a comment her husband made one day while he was immersed in a football game on TV. “It was a throwaway comment, designed to annoy and it did. It was along the lines of...,” The idea stuck, and Harris began thinking that “people have these conflicting feelings about chocolate, and that a lot of people who have very little else in common relate to chocolate in more or less the same kind of way. It became a kind of challenge to see exactly how much of a story I could get which was uniquely centred around chocolate.”,Rich with metaphor and gorgeous writing...sit back and gorge yourself on,.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Romance,Magical Realism,Cultural,France,Fantasy,Contemporary,Food and Drink,Food,Historical,Historical Fiction,Womens Fiction,Chick Lit,Adult","Caro Clairmont,Josephine Bonnet,Anouk Rocher,Vianne Rocher,Roux,Francis Reynaud,Armande Voizin,Paul-Marie Muscat,Luc Clairmont,Guillaume Duplessis","Lansquenet-sous-Tannes,France",English,2000,3.95

Narrated with irrepressible humor and rare candor, and including personal photographs, Three Weeks with my Brother reminds us to embrace life with all its uncertainties. . . and most of all, to cherish the joyful times, both small and momentous, and the wonderful people who make them possible.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Nonfiction,Autobiography,Memoir,Travel,Biography,Romance,Biography Memoir,Biography,Autobiography,Adult,Womens Fiction,Chick Lit,Audiobook","Nick Sparks,Micah Sparks","Sacramento, California",English,April 13th 2004,4.02

Life among the warring factions in Scotland was dangerous for the infant Queen, however, and at age five Mary was sent to France to be raised alongside her betrothed, the Dauphin Francois. Surrounded by all the sensual comforts of the French court, Mary's youth was peaceful, charmed, and when she became Queen of France at the age of sixteen, she seemed to have all she could wish for. But by her eighteenth birthday, Mary was a widow who had lost one throne and had been named by the Pope for another. And her extraordinary adventure had only begun. Defying her powerful cousin Elizabeth I, Mary set sail in 1561 to take her place as the Catholic Queen of a newly Protestant Scotland. A virtual stranger in her volatile native land, Mary would be hailed as a saint, denounced as a whore, and ultimately accused of murdering her second husband, Lord Darnley, in order to marry her lover, the Earl of Bothwell. She was but twenty-five years old when she fled Scotland for the imagined sanctuary of Elizabeth's England, where she would be embroiled in intrigue until she was beheaded \like a criminal\ in 1587. In her stunning first novel, The Autobiography of Henry VIII, Margaret George established herself as one of the finest historical novelists of our time. Now she brings us a new, mesmerizing blend of history and storytelling as she turns the astonishing facts of the life of Mary Queen of Scots into magnificent fiction that sweeps us from the glittering French court where Mary spent her youth, to the bloodstained Scotland where she reigned as Queen, to the cold English castles where she ended her days. Never before have we been offered such arich and moving portrayal of the Scots Queen, whose beauty inspired poetry, whose spirit brought forth both devotion and hatred, and whose birthright generated glorious dreams, hideous treachery, and murdered men at her feet.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Historical,Historical Fiction,Fiction,Historical,Cultural,Scotland,English History,Tudor Period,European Literature,British Literature,Literature,16th Century,Adult Fiction,Cultural,France,Novels","Mary, Queen of Scots",Scotland,English,April 15th 1997,4.06

According to historian Joseph Ellis,,is “a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.”,Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow’s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today’s America is the result of Hamilton’s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. “To repudiate his legacy,” Chernow writes, “is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.” Chernow here recounts Hamilton’s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington’s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America’s birth as the triumph of Jefferson’s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we’ve encountered before—from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton’s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.,Chernow’s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America’s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots,,will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,History,Biography,Nonfiction,North American Hi...,American History,Politics,Audiobook,Historical,Biography Memoir,Military History,American Revolution,Unfinished","Alexander Hamilton,Aaron Burr,George Washington,Thomas Jefferson,James Madison",United States of America,English,March 29th 2005,4.18

Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion:,\Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.\,When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale? Only the dead are above suspicion.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Mystery,Classics,Fiction,Mystery,Crime,Thriller,Thriller,Mystery Thriller,Audiobook,Adult,Suspense,Novels","Justice Lawrence John Wargrave,Vera Elizabeth Claythorne,Philip Lombard,General John Gordon Macarthur,Dr Edward George Armstrong,Anthony James Marston,William Henry Blore,Mr Thomas Rogers,Mrs Ethel Rogers,Emily Caroline Brent,Isaac Morris,Fred Narracott","United Kingdom,Devon Coast, England,Devon, England",English,May 3rd 2004,4.26

So long as he is ready. So long as he is, above all, afraid.,Jimmy Tock comes into the world on the very night his grandfather leaves it. As a violent storm rages outside the hospital, Rudy Tock spends long hours walking the corridors between the expectant fathers' waiting room and his dying father's bedside. It's a strange vigil made all the stranger when, at the very height of the storm's fury, Josef Tock suddenly sits up in bed and speaks coherently for the first and last time since his stroke.,What he says before he dies is that there will be five dark days in the life of his grandson – five dates whose terrible events Jimmy will have to prepare himself to face. The first is to occur in his 20th year; the second in his 23rd year; the third in his 28th; the fourth in his 29th; the fifth in his 30th.,Rudy is all too ready to discount his father's last words as a dying man's delusional rambling. But then he discovers that Josef also predicted the moment of his grandson's birth to the minute, as well as his exact height, weight, and the fact that Jimmy would be born with syndactyly – the unexplained anomaly of fused digits on his left foot. Suddenly, the old man's predictions take on a chilling significance.,What terrifying events await Jimmy on these five dark days? What nightmares will he face? What challenges must he survive? As the novel unfolds, picking up Jimmy's story at each of these crisis points, the path he must follow will defy every expectation. And with each crisis he faces, he will move closer to a fate he could never have imagined. For who Jimmy Tock is and what he must accomplish on the five days his world turns is a mystery as dangerous as it is wondrous – a struggle against an evil so dark and pervasive only the most extraordinary of human spirits can shine through.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Horror,Fiction,Thriller,Mystery,Suspense,Fantasy,Thriller,Mystery Thriller,Audiobook,Humor,Fantasy,Paranormal","Jimmy Tock,Rudy Tock,James \Jimmy\ Tock,Lorrie Tock,Konrad Beezo","United States of America,Colorado",English,October 25th 2005,3.97

Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown.,But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. He and his half-Tlingit partner, Berko Shemets, can't catch a break in any of their outstanding cases. Landsman's new supervisor is the love of his life—and also his worst nightmare. And in the cheap hotel where he has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under Landsman's nose.

But when word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, Landsman soon finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, hopefulness, evil, and salvation that are his heritage—and with the unfinished business of his marriage to Bina Gelbfish, the one person who understands his darkest fears.,At once a gripping whodunit, a love story, an homage to 1940s noir, and an exploration of the mysteries of exile and redemption, The Yiddish Policemen's Union is a novel only Michael Chabon could have written.,front flap","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Mystery,Science Fiction,Science Fiction,Alternate History,Mystery,Crime,Literature,Jewish,Fantasy,Novels,Literature,Literary Fiction","Meyer Landsman,Berko Shemets,Bina Gelbfish,Ester-Malke Shemets,Hertz Shemets,Alter Litvak,Mendel Shpilman,Itzik Zimbalist,Naomi Landsman","Sitka, Alaska",English,May 1st 2007,3.71

This new paperback edition-introduced by noted American writer John Updike-celebrates the 150th anniversary of this classic work. Much of Walden's material is derived from Thoreau's journals and contains such engaging pieces as \Reading\ and \The Pond in the Winter\ Other famous sections involve Thoreau's visits with a Canadian woodcutter and with an Irish family, a trip to Concord, and a description of his bean field. This is the complete and authoritative text of Walden-as close to Thoreau's original intention as all available evidence allows. For the student and for the general reader, this is the ideal presentation of Thoreau's great document of social criticism and dissent.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Classics,Philosophy,Nonfiction,Environment,Nature,Autobiography,Memoir,Literature,Biography,Writing,Essays,Literature,American,Environment",Henry David Thoreau,"United States of America,Concord, Massachusetts",English,April 18th 2004,3.78

The first part of the book deals with his childhood and youth and his longing to become a successful farmer and hard-hitting fighter like his father.,The tough life of cattle-farming is brusquely interrupted by the Zulu Wars, when Sean and his brother see fighting for the first time. Wilbur Smith vividly recreates the excitement of the war for the young men-their hope of winning their own cattle, the horror of the massacre at Isandhlwana, the heroism of the defence at Rorkes Drift.,'Witwatersrand' is the name of the second part of this book and it tells the story of Sean's fabulous success in the gold rush and his rich life with Duff Charleywood and the beautiful Candy in the new town of Johannesburg, where huge fortunes were made and lost in a morning's dealing on the Exchange.,The atmosphere of this feverish, violent time is brilliantly drawn: the heavy drinking, the elaborate houses, the ruthless abandonment of the failure. Sean and Duff are caught at last in a trap laid by their rival, the sinister and clever Hradsky, and leave Johannesburg for the wilderness to seek their fortunes once more.,And now the book moves to its climax. At last it seems as though Sean will settle to a quiet married life – but fate has other plans for him. They return to Johannesburg and tragedy strikes quickly.

The first of these stories traces Okonkwo's fall from grace with the tribal world in which he lives, and in its classical purity of line and economical beauty it provides us with a powerful fable about the immemorial conflict between the individual and society.,The second story, which is as modern as the first is ancient, and which elevates the book to a tragic plane, concerns the clash of cultures and the destruction of Okonkwo's world through the arrival of aggressive, proselytizing European missionaries. These twin dramas are perfectly harmonized, and they are modulated by an awareness capable of encompassing at once the life of nature, human history, and the mysterious compulsions of the soul.

Now, Antonia Fraser goes behind the well-known tales of Louis’s accomplishments and follies, exploring in riveting detail his intimate relationships with women.,The king’s mother, Anne of Austria, had been in a childless marriage for twenty-two years before she gave birth to Louis XIV. A devout Catholic, she instilled in her son a strong sense of piety and fought successfully for his right to absolute power. In 1660, Louis married his first cousin, Marie-Thérèse, in a political arrangement. While unfailingly kind to the official \Queen of Versailles,\ Louis sought others to satisfy his romantic and sexual desires. After a flirtation with his sister-in-law, his first important mistress was Louise de La Vallière, who bore him several children before being replaced by the tempestuous and brilliant Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan. Later, when Athénaïs’s reputation was tarnished, the king continued to support her publicly until Athénaïs left court for a life of repentance. Meanwhile her children’s governess, the intelligent and seemingly puritanical Françoise de Maintenon, had already won the king’s affections; in a relationship in complete contrast to his physical obsession with Athénaïs, Louis XIV lived happily with Madame de Maintenon for the rest of his life, very probably marrying her in secret. When his grandson’s child bride, the enchanting Adelaide of Savoy, came to Versaille she lightened the king’s last years—until tragedy struck.,With consummate skill, Antonia Fraser weaves insights into the nature of women’s religious lives—as well as such practical matters as contraception—into her magnificent, sweeping portrait of the king, his court, and his ladies.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,History,Nonfiction,Biography,Cultural,France,Historical,Literature,17th Century,History,European History,Audiobook,Biography Memoir,Literature,18th Century",Louis XIV of France,Versailles,English,March 20th 2007,3.87

But to make it a lucrative farming state, much of the land had to be deforested, leaving behind devastated habitats. The Limberlost, a wetland in northern Indiana, was mostly destroyed by drainage, logging and oil production. Gene Stratton-Porter, an early 20th-century naturalist and novelist, captured the fading beauty of the swamp in books like A Girl of the Limberlost, a novel about a smart, ambitious girl who lives in the dwindling wetland with her mother and pays for school by collecting local moth specimens to sell to naturalists. The book isn’t exactly an environmentalist tract, but it makes the case nonetheless: It celebrates the beauty and richness of the swampland, while showing how easily economic forces push landowners to strip it away.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Classics,Fiction,Young Adult,Historical,Historical Fiction,Childrens,Romance,Historical,Environment,Nature,Young Adult,Coming Of Age,Childrens,Middle Grade",Elnora Comstock,Indiana,English,January 30th 2004,4.15

1635,1635,In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex,Nathaniel Philbrick,"\With its huge, scarred head halfway out of the water and its tail beating the ocean into a white-water wake more than forty feet across, the whale approached the ship at twice its original speed - at least six knots. With a tremendous cracking and splintering of oak, it struck the ship just beneath the anchor secured at the cat-head on the port bow...\,\With its huge, scarred head halfway out of the water and its tail beating the ocean into a white-water wake more than forty feet across, the whale approached the ship at twice its original speed - at least six knots. With a tremendous cracking and splintering of oak, it struck the ship just beneath the anchor secured at the cat-head on the port bow...\,brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours, and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick. In a harrowing page-turner, Nathaniel Philbrick restores this epic story to its rightful place in American history.,In 1820, the 240-ton Essex set sail from Nantucket on a routine voyage for whales. Fifteen months later, in the farthest reaches of the South Pacific, it was repeatedly rammed and sunk by an eighty-ton bull sperm whale. Its twenty-man crew, fearing cannibals on the islands to the west, made for the 3,000-mile-distant coast of South America in three tiny boats. During ninety days at sea under horrendous conditions, the survivors clung to life as one by one, they succumbed to hunger, thirst, disease, and fear.,Philbrick interweaves his account of this extraordinary ordeal of ordinary men with a wealth of whale lore and with a brilliantly detailed portrait of the lost, unique community of Nantucket whalers. Impeccably researched and beautifully told, the book delivers the ultimate portrait of man against nature, drawing on a remarkable range of archival and modern sources, including a long-lost account by the ship's cabin boy.,At once a literary companion and a page-turner that speaks to the same issues of class, race, and man's relationship to nature that permeate the works of Melville,,will endure as a vital work of American history.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,History,Nonfiction,Adventure,Historical,Adventure,Survival,North American Hi...,American History,Audiobook,Biography,Adventure,Maritime,Adult","George Pollard,Thomas Nickerson,Owen Chase,Benjamin Lawrence,Matthew Joy,Thomas Chappel,Owen Coffin,Barzillai Ray","Nantucket, Massachusetts,South Pacific",English,May 1st 2001,4.11

These “night people” are haunted by secrets and needs that draw them together more powerfully than the differing circumstances that might keep them apart, and it soon becomes clear that Eri’s slumber—mysteriously tied to the businessman plagued by the mark of his crime—will either restore or annihilate her.,moves from mesmerizing drama to metaphysical speculation, interweaving time and space as well as memory and perspective into a seamless exploration of human agency—the interplay between self-expression and empathy, between the power of observation and the scope of compassion and love.

Seniors are scrambling to finish their theses. And two students, Tom Sullivan and Paul Harris, are a hair's breadth from solving the mysteries of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili--a renowned text attributed to an Italian nobleman, a work that has baffled scholars since its publication in 1499. For Tom, their research has been a link to his family's past -- and an obstacle to the woman he loves. For Paul, it has become an obsession, the very reason for living. But as their deadline looms, research has stalled -- until a long-lost diary surfaces with a vital clue. And when a fellow researcher is murdered just hours later, Tom and Paul realize that they are not the first to glimpse the Hypnerotomachia 's secrets.,Suddenly the stakes are raised, and as the two friends sift through the codes and riddles at the heart of the text, they are beginnning to see the manuscript in a new light--not simply as a story of faith, eroticism and pedantry, but as a bizarre, coded mathematical maze.

His father, Nikolai, gladly receives the two young men at his estate, called Maryino, but Nikolai's brother, Pavel, soon becomes upset by the strange new philosophy called \nihilism\ which the young men advocate.,Fathers and Sons 1862 is regarded as one of the major works of 19th-century fiction. The novel was the most closely studied of Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev's works in the Soviet high school curriculum. The novel seemed a perfect vehicle for portraying the brewing unrest of the pre-revolutionary era and introduced the character of Bazarov -- the spirited nihilist who was seen as a brilliant idealistic rebel, the new kind of perfect man who rejected the old notions of class and came to disrupt nobility's status quo. Growing up, Turgenev witnessed much class injustice in Russia, and his themes reflect his overwhelming concern with the suffering of the poor and the voiceless serfs. But FATHERS AND SONS is not merely a convenient socio-political piece; Turgenev is a lyrical romantic. At the novel's heart lies the ultimately tragic human story of Bazarov's flippant kiss of a servant girl and the bizarre tension it causes in a cozy country gentry household where he is a guest.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Classics,Fiction,Cultural,Russia,Literature,Russian Literature,Literature,Literature,19th Century,Novels,Historical,Historical Fiction,Philosophy,Literary Fiction","Arkady Kirsanov,Piyotr,Nicolay Petroviç Kirsanov,Agafokleya Kuzminishna Kirsanov,Masha Kirsanov,Prokofyic,Fenicka Kirsanov,Mitya Kirsanov,Matyei Ilyic Kolyazin,Sitnikov,Yevdoksiya Kushkina,Anna Sergeeyevna Odintson,Katya Nikolayevic Lokten Kirsanov,Arina Vlasyevna Bazarov,Vasiliy Ivanovic Bazarov,Porfiriy Dlatonyic,Evgeny Bazarov",Russian Empire,English,September 1st 2003,3.96

But his abductors are little more than children themselves.,Ranging in ages from 12 to 19, Mark's abductors are in the process of escaping from a sadistic pedophile known to them only as \Grendel\ a man whose practices include torture and mutilation specifically, mutilation of the face.,Mark's abductors have all been mutilated by Grendel, who may be very close behind them, and need someone with a \normal face\ to help them carry out their plan for justice and return home.,For the next few days, Mark will come to understand not only the inhuman horror that these children have suffered, but how they eventually learned to fight back and how they discovered that Grendel and his practices are at the center of a very complex network catering to those whose tastes run toward the molestation and mutilation of children.,Prodigal Blues is perhaps Braunbeck's most suspenseful and emotionally powerful work to date; a story of suffering, depravity, redemption, and in the end the individual's compassion for his or her fellow human beings that can lead some people to find reserves of courage and determination they never thought they possessed.,Terrifying, suspenseful, sometimes surprisingly funny, and ultimately moving, Prodigal Blues is quintessential Braunbeck.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Horror,Thriller,Mystery,Crime,Mystery,Fiction,Thriller,Mystery Thriller,Dark",Mark Sieber,Missouri,English,May 1st 2006,4.22

These consoling fantasies are her heart's answer to the family story that as a child, in unclear circumstances, Lily accidentally shot and killed her mother. All Lily has left of Deborah is a strange image of a Black Madonna, with the words \Tiburon, South Carolina\ scrawled on the back. The search for a mother, and the need to mother oneself, are crucial elements in this well-written coming-of-age story set in the early 1960s against a background of racial violence and unrest. When Lily's beloved nanny, Rosaleen, manages to insult a group of angry white men on her way to register to vote and has to skip town, Lily takes the opportunity to go with her, fleeing to the only place she can think of--Tiburon, South Carolina--determined to find out more about her dead mother. Although the plot threads are too neatly trimmed,,is a carefully crafted novel with an inspired depiction of character. The legend of the Black Madonna and the brave, kind, peculiar women who perpetuate Lily's story dominate the second half of the book, placing Kidd's debut novel squarely in the honored tradition of the Southern Gothic.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction,Young Adult,Classics,Adult Fiction,Historical,Contemporary,Young Adult,Coming Of Age,Adult,Novels","Lily Owens,Rosaleen,August Boatwright,June Boatwright,May Boatwright,T.

She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be.,To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone. Eat, Pray, Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way—unexpectedly.,An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery, Eat, Pray, Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society’s ideals. It is certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Nonfiction,Autobiography,Memoir,Travel,Biography,Womens Fiction,Chick Lit,Romance,Spirituality,Biography Memoir,Contemporary,Biography,Autobiography","Liz Gilbert,Felipe,Richard from Texas,Wayan","Italy,India,Bali",English,February 1st 2007,3.58
